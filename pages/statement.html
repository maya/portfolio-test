        <p>“I see with an eye that feels… I feel with a hand that sees…” Goethe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I sit in my studio trying to galvanize my thoughts and ideas that define my artistic work, I always come back&nbsp;to the sentence above. It guides me and reaffirms my process. It is the matter, the eye and the hand that interact. It is the process, the experience and the need to define space over and over again that stays in my artistic endeavor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I work with industrial materials that in the real world are designed to build houses. I explore the relationships between contradicted surfaces. For example: the varnish aluminum stands by wood or wax. Each material has its own character. Each matter reacts to the one next to it, and to the surrounding environment. The aluminum reflects and returns the light. The wax lets the light go through.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aluminum, wax, wood and mesh are all building materials. I take them to construct a different space.</p>
        <p><br>My space is an expansion of man made architectural structures. It is a landscape that starts within and grows into the unknown. It is tangible, perhaps recognizable and affirming, but yet new, pure and magical.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My wishes in the future are to deepen the investigation of matter and space either in a gallery or in the open environment. I would like to invent new surfaces and new objects. I would like to witness a change in perception, a change that will greatly surprise me.</p>
